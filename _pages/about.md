<hr/>

I obtained my PhD at Télécom Paris in Institut Polytechnique de Paris. My thesis is about using Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to realize the creation of multiple dynamic smart home services. Furthermore, rule extraction algorithm is also introduced to ensure that the created MARL services would be explainable. I'm currently looking for a postdoc or research job on machine learning algorithms. 

My research
======
My research interest focus on:
* Reinforcement Learning
* Data Assimilation
* Optimization
* Computer vision
